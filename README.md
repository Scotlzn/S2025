# Summer 2025

> This repo is a collection of supercurricular projects that I have developed in my spare time.
> Projects range from simple games to larger projects and simulations.

### Project #1 - *Maze generation*

> Simple maze generation visualisation using the Hunt-and-Kill algorithm.
> Project Finished: 24/07/2025

### Project #2 - *Wave function collapse*

> Wave function collapse algorithm visualisation with 2 sets of tiles and multiple backtracking modes to prevent contradictions as this is the main drawback of the algorithm.
> Project Finished: 29/07/2025

### Project #3 - *Minesweeper*

> Simple minesweeper game using mouse controls. The game includes a timer and the ability to place flags to mark known bombs. It uses the flood fill algorithm initially to start the game.
> Project Finished: 31/07/2025

### Project #4 - *A\* search*

> A* search algorithm visualiser with placeable objects and a maze generator using the Aldous-Broder Wilson hybrid algorithm. The start and end of the search are also changeable as is the size of the grid.
> Project Finished: 03/08/2025

### Project #4 - *Chess engine*

> Chess engine completely in vanilla Javascript with the full chess rule set.
> Project Finished: 13/08/2025
